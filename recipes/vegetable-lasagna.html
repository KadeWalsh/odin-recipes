            Steps
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large saucepan, heat water to boiling for lasagna noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                While water heats, prepare sauce. In a skillet, combine tomato sauce, drained tomatoes, Italian salad dressing, Italian seasonings and chopped garlic. Heat to boiling over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to lowest setting and simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water according to package directions.
            </li>
            <li>
                As lasagna noodles cook and sauce simmers, make cheese filling. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half the mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and nutmeg. Mix together well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chopped zucchini, chopped spinach and chopped onion to cheese mixture. Stir to blend.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain and rinse lasagna noodles. Spray a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide sauce and cheese/vegetable mixture into two; divide lasagna noodles into three. Make the casserole by creating one layer of noodles, sauce and cheese/vegetable mixture and then another layer of noodles, sauce and cheese/vegetable mixture. The remaining noodles are layered on top. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until casserole is lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove lasagna from oven and let stand while garlic cheese bread toasts in hot oven.        </ol>
            </li>
